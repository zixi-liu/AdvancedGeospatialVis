# Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification

Purpose: This is a tutorial on Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification methods and use cases.

There is a wide range of applications of remote sensing image classification, such as natural hazards detection, LULC determination, geospatial object detection, geographic image retrieval, vegetation mapping, environment monitoring, and urban planning. The advances of remote sensing technology has significantly increased spatial resolution and the within class variability.

We will focus on the spatial patterns created by pixels rather than the statistical analysis of single pixels in use cases. For semantic-level remote sensing image scene classification, a scene image usually refers to a local image patch manually extracted from large scale remote sensing images that contain explicit semantic classes (e.g., commercial area, industrial area, and residential area).

Unsupervised Feature Learning Based Methods: principal component analysis (PCA) [135], k-means clustering, sparse coding [136], and autoencoder [137]. It is worth noting that some unsupervised feature learning models such as sparse coding and autoencoder can be easily stacked to form deeper unsupervised models.
